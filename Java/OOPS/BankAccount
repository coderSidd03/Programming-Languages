// Create a new class for a bank account
// Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number.
//
//
// Create getters and setters for each field
// Create two additional methods
// 1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field).
// 2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balance field,
// but not allow the withdrawal to complete if their are insufficient funds.
// You will want to create various code in the Main class (the one created by IntelliJ) to
// confirm your code is working.
// Add some System.out.println's in the two methods above as well.
